# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: Using Nuke as a main software when I was working for visual effect companies for a couple of years attracted me to the computer science. 
  I honed my computer skills by graduating from Concordia University with a Graduate Diploma in Computer Science degree. 
  Gained my quality assurance analyst expertise by joining to Morgan & Stanley company which gave me the opportunity to 
  hand-on experience working closely with full-stack features teams to deliver complete components for boarder platform integration 
  and leveraged various technologies and tools, including LINUX, SQL, GIT Bitbuckets, Object Oriented Programming (OOP), 
  and delivered work using Agile (Kanban) methodologies, analyzed requirement and performed functional and regression tests based on developer instruction.
