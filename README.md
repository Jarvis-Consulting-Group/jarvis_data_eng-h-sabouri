# Hossein Sabouri . Jarvis Consulting

Using Nuke as a main software when I was working for visual effect companies for a couple of years attracted me to the computer science. I honed my computer skills by graduating from Concordia University with a Graduate Diploma in Computer Science degree. Gained my quality assurance analyst expertise by joining to Morgan & Stanley company which gave me the opportunity to hand-on experience working closely with full-stack features teams to deliver complete components for boarder platform integration and leveraged various technologies and tools, including LINUX, SQL, GIT Bitbuckets, Object Oriented Programming (OOP), and delivered work using Agile (Kanban) methodologies, analyzed requirement and performed functional and regression tests based on developer instruction.

**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_demo/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Deployed a project to collect hardware specification and also monitor the cluster nodes resource usage in real time. The collected data will be stored in an RDBMS database for this we use posgres sql database. The data can help to manage reports for future resource planning purposes.
